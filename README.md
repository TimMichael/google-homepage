The purpose of this project is to deconstruct a website and then rebuild it. 
In order to achieve this I will mostly rely on Chrome DevOps to study the structure.

Things learned:
* How to pinpoint something that I'm looking for in Chrome DevOps
* Basic Git workflow in Command Line
* How to create a top and bottom navigation bar and move around elements in that space.
* Basic design in CSS makes much more sense now. (Padding, margins, flex, border etc.)
* After several attempts I eventually landed with a more structured HTML code.
* Simple :hover effects on links

Til' next time:
* :hover effect on the search form. Want to learn how to create that backdrop shadow.
* :focus on the search form. Remove that black box that appears.
* :hover effects on buttons etc.
* Add that extra "flair"
